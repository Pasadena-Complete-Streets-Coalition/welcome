# Welcome to the Pasadena Complete Streets Coalition GitHub
GitHub is where PasCSC manages projects and keeps track of todos.

## What is GitHub
GitHub is a website where people can collaborate on projects. PasCSC uses the Repositories, Issues, and Milestones features of GitHub to manage projects and todos. In this context, you can think of GitHub Milestones as PasCSC projects and GitHub Issues as PasCSC todos and each repository (repo for short) as a collection of related projects and todos.

Some of our repos are public and viewable by everyone while others are private and viewable only by invitation. To gain access to the private repos follow the `Sign-up` instructions below. 

## Usage Guide

### Sign-up for todo repo
The todo repo is intented for any PasCSC member to use to manage todos and projects. If you are new to GitHub, ask for help on the PasCSC Google Groups.

1. Create a free github account at github.com
2. Email your github name to Jonah and Matt and ask them to add you to the todo repo
3. You should get an email invitation to join the repo.  Follow instructions to join.
